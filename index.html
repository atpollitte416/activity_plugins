    <p>for this activity, I chose the "Bluehost Blueprint" theme. I chose this theme because It is very simple to understand the layout because it is a block-based theme. For my plug-in, I chose the "Health Check & Troubleshooting" Plug-in. I chose this plug-in because makes troubleshooting easier by identifying common problems, and helps troubleshoot plug-in and theme conflicts. </p>
